### API Improvements

New API endpoints:

- `GET /api/agents/:id?includeLatestRun=true` - Get agent details with latest run
- `GET /api/agents/:id/runs` - Get all runs for a specific agent
- `GET /api/pipelines/:id?includeLatestRun=true` - Get pipeline details with latest run
- `GET /api/pipelines/:id/runs` - Get all runs for a specific pipeline

Enhanced response formats:
- Better error messages with detailed information
