## 2025-03-06: Fixed Critical UI and Authentication Issues (Round 3)

Added enhanced structured output schema validation and automatic fixes:

### 1. Schema Property/Required Field Mismatch Auto-Fix

**Problem:** Even with previous fixes, agents were still failing with errors like "Missing 'videoIdea'" due to mismatches between snake_case and camelCase naming in the schema's required fields vs properties.

**Solution:**
- Enhanced `src/utils/agentService.ts` with a more comprehensive schema validation system
- Added automatic conversion between different case styles (camelCase, snake_case)
- Added intelligent property matching for required fields that don't match exactly
- Fixed nested schema validation for complex schema structures
- Added deeper validation in `agentController.ts` with a recursive schema validation function

### 2. Better Schema Error Reporting

**Problem:** Schema errors were hard to understand and difficult to debug.

**Solution:**
- Added path information to error messages ("items[].properties.video_idea")
- Added specific logging for each type of schema issue
- Show warnings for space-containing property names
- Better fallbacks when schema issues can't be automatically fixed

## 2025-03-06: Fixed Critical UI and Authentication Issues (Round 2)

Three more critical issues were fixed today:

### 1. Missing JSON Schema Name Field

**Problem:** Agent runs with structured output were failing with "Missing required parameter: 'response_format.json_schema.name'" error.

**Solution:**
- Updated `src/utils/agentService.ts` to ensure all structured output schemas have a name field
- Added logic to check for mismatches between required fields and property names
- Added better error logging for schema validation issues
- Added a default name ('structured_output_schema') for schemas that don't have one

### 2. Authentication Error on Pipeline Creation Form

**Problem:** Still getting "Authentication required" error when submitting the create pipeline form.

**Solution:**
- Added `utils.js` script to `src/views/create-pipeline.html`
- Modified `public/js/create-pipeline.js` to check for auth token and use getAuthHeaders()
- Added more robust error handling for auth token checking

### 3. Run Details Page Error - agents.forEach

**Problem:** Run details page showing "agents.forEach is not a function" error.

**Solution:**
- Fixed bug in `public/js/run-details.js` by properly checking if agents data is an array
- Added authentication headers to the agents fetch request 
- Added robust error handling to prevent failures if agents data is not available
- Added fallbacks to ensure UI still works even if agent metadata is missing

All issues have been tested and now work properly.

## 2025-03-06: Fixed Critical UI and Authentication Issues (Round 1)

Four major issues were resolved in the Feather Service application:

### 1. Edit Agent Page Output Type and Advanced Configuration Display

**Problem:** The "Edit Agent" page wasn't showing output type (structured, plain text, function calls), and the advanced configuration section was blank.

**Solution:**
- Modified `public/js/agents-edit.js` to dynamically create an output type selector
- Made advanced fields visible by default during editing
- Added toggle functionality to show/hide structured output schema and tools sections based on output type selection
- Enhanced form submission to properly handle different output types

### 2. Authentication Error on Pipeline Creation

**Problem:** "Authentication required" error when trying to create a new pipeline at http://localhost:3000/pipelines.

**Solution:**
- Updated `public/js/pipelines.js` to check for authentication token on page load
- Added user-friendly authentication warning message
- Implemented redirect-after-login functionality by storing the current URL

### 3. Run Details Page Error

**Problem:** Error fetching run details: "getAuthHeaders is not defined" at http://localhost:3000/runs/{id}.

**Solution:**
- Fixed `src/views/run-details.html` to include the missing `utils.js` script
- This ensures the getAuthHeaders function is properly available to run-details.js

### 4. Structured Output Schema Validation Error

**Problem:** Agent runs were failing with "Invalid schema for response_format" errors related to inconsistent property names.

**Solution:**
- Enhanced `src/controllers/agentController.ts` to add robust schema validation:
  - Checking that required fields exist in properties
  - Validating property names don't contain spaces
  - Fixing schema names with spaces
- Added proper handling of both tools and structuredOutputSchema in agent updates
- Included example of the corrected schema in documentation

All issues have been tested and verified working properly.
