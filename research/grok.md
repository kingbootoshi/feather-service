Yes, your vision for creating a hosted server that leverages the Feather framework to build and manage AI agent pipelines aligns well with how Feather operates and can be practically implemented. Below, I’ll explain how everything makes sense in terms of Feather’s capabilities and outline how your templated service can work as a 24/7 server, addressing each of your requirements step-by-step.
Understanding Feather and Your Goals
The Feather framework is a lightweight wrapper around LLM API calls, enhancing them with features like tool calling and structured outputs. It allows you to define agents with configurations such as a model, system prompt, and optional tools or output schemas, and execute them with the .run() method. Your goal is to create a hosted server that:
Provides a UI to create and configure Feather agents.
Enables chaining these agents into pipelines where outputs from one agent feed into the next.
Standardizes agent outputs for seamless communication.
Runs pipelines 24/7, triggered via API calls, with outputs distributable to various destinations (e.g., Discord, Slack, email).
This is entirely feasible with Feather, and I’ll detail how to achieve it.
Core Components of Your Hosted Server
1. Creating Feather Agents via UI
You want to create agents like “Agent A” (an idea creator) and “Agent B” (a script creator) through a user interface. Feather agents are defined with parameters such as:
Model: The LLM to use (e.g., deepseek/deepseek-chat via OpenRouter).
System Prompt: Defines the agent’s behavior (e.g., “You are an idea creator that generates video ideas from text input”).
Tools: Optional functions for manual or auto-executed tasks (e.g., a tool to process input text).
Structured Output Schema: Optional, for returning JSON objects instead of plain text.
Example Agent Definitions:
Agent A (Idea Creator):
typescript
const agentA = new FeatherAgent({
  model: "openai/gpt-4o",
  systemPrompt: "You are an idea creator that generates creative video ideas based on input text.",
  // No tools or structured output; output will be plain text
});
Agent B (Script Creator):
typescript
const agentB = new FeatherAgent({
  model: "openai/gpt-4o",
  systemPrompt: "You are a script creator that writes video scripts based on input ideas.",
  // No tools or structured output; output will be plain text
});
UI Implementation:
A web-based UI (e.g., built with React) allows users to input these parameters.
Fields include model selection, system prompt text, and optional tool assignments from a predefined server-side list (e.g., text processing tools) to ensure security.
Agents are saved to the server’s database with unique IDs.
2. Standardizing Agent Outputs
Feather’s AgentRunResult provides outputs in different forms based on configuration:
Plain Text: A string (e.g., a video idea from Agent A).
Structured Output: A typed object (e.g., { idea: string, details: string }).
Tool Call Results: With autoExecuteTools: true (default), the agent executes tools and re-runs itself, returning a final string response incorporating tool results.
To chain agents, outputs must be standardized. Your requirement is that any agent can receive and communicate with others’ outputs. Here’s how to handle this:
Approach: Convert all outputs to strings for consistency, as LLMs typically accept string inputs.
Plain Text: Pass directly (e.g., Agent A’s video idea string to Agent B).
Structured Output: Stringify the JSON object (e.g., JSON.stringify(result.output)).
Tool Results: Use the final string response after tool execution.
Why This Works: Feather’s .output is a string for plain text and tool-executed responses, and structured outputs can be converted to strings. This ensures a uniform input format for the next agent.
Flexibility: To support cases where only part of a structured output is needed (e.g., result.output.idea), the pipeline can include an “input extractor” configuration per agent, specifying how to derive its input from the previous output:
direct: Use the output as-is (for strings).
field: 'idea': Extract output.idea from an object.
json: Use JSON.stringify(output).
Example Output Handling:
Agent A runs with input “latest AI news” and outputs: "A video about AI breakthroughs in 2023".
Agent B receives this string directly and outputs: "[Script] Intro: Welcome to our video on AI breakthroughs in 2023...".
3. Creating Agent Pipelines
You want to chain Agent A and Agent B into “Pipeline 1,” where Agent A’s output feeds into Agent B. Here’s how:
Pipeline Definition:
A pipeline is a sequence of agents with configurations for how each agent’s input is derived.
Stored as:
typescript
const pipeline1 = [
  { agentId: "agentA" }, // First agent takes external input
  { agentId: "agentB", inputExtractor: { type: "direct" } } // Takes Agent A’s output as-is
];
Execution Flow:
API call to /pipelines/1/run with input: "latest AI news".
Server creates a fresh agentA instance, runs it with "latest AI news", gets output: "A video about AI breakthroughs in 2023".
Applies inputExtractor: direct to pass this string to agentB.
Runs agentB, gets output: "[Script] Intro: Welcome to our video on AI breakthroughs in 2023...".
This is Pipeline 1’s final output.
24/7 Operation: The server runs as a long-lived process (e.g., Node.js with Express), listening for API calls to trigger pipelines.
4. API and Output Management
You want to read pipeline outputs and distribute them to various destinations.
API Endpoints:
Trigger Pipeline: POST /pipelines/:id/run
Request: { "input": "latest AI news" }
Response: { "runId": "123" } (async execution).
Get Pipeline Outputs: GET /pipelines/runs/:runId
Returns: { "status": "success", "outputs": [{ "agentId": "agentA", "output": "..." }, ...], "finalOutput": "..." }.
Standard Output Distribution:
Each pipeline has configurable output destinations:
typescript
{
  id: "pipeline1",
  outputDestinations: [
    { type: "webhook", url: "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/..." },
    { type: "webhook", url: "https://slack.com/api/..." },
    { type: "email", to: "user@example.com" }
  ]
}
After Pipeline 1 completes, the server sends the final output (Agent B’s script) to all destinations:
Discord/Slack: HTTP POST to webhook URLs with the output.
Email: Use an email service (e.g., SendGrid) to send the output.
Implementation:
Upon pipeline completion, the server iterates through outputDestinations and dispatches the output accordingly.
Logs the run (input, agent outputs, status) in a database for retrieval via API.
Does This Make Sense?
Yes, this aligns with Feather’s functionality and your requirements:
Feather Compatibility: Agents are lightweight and configurable as you described, supporting plain text, tools, and structured outputs. The .run() method’s output variations are manageable with a standardized string-based approach or input extractors.
Pipeline Chaining: Feather agents can be sequenced by passing outputs as inputs, with the server handling the flow.
24/7 Server: A Node.js server with API endpoints can run continuously, processing pipeline requests and distributing outputs.
UI and API: A web UI for agent/pipeline creation and API for triggering and monitoring fit naturally with this architecture.
Implementation Outline
Here’s a high-level plan to build your service:
Server Setup:
Use Node.js with Express.js and TypeScript.
Database (e.g., SQLite) for agents, pipelines, and run logs.
Environment: Set OPENROUTER_API_KEY for LLM calls.
Agent Management:
CRUD endpoints: /agents (create, read, update, delete).
Store Feather configurations (model, prompt, tools).
Pipeline Management:
CRUD endpoints: /pipelines.
Store agent sequences with input extractors and output destinations.
Pipeline Execution:
Endpoint: POST /pipelines/:id/run.
Logic: Create fresh agent instances, run in sequence, apply input extractors, save outputs.
Output Distribution:
After execution, send final output to configured webhooks/emails.
Use libraries like axios for webhooks and nodemailer for email.
UI:
Web app (e.g., React) to interact with API.
Forms for agent creation (prompt, model, tools) and pipeline setup (agent sequence, input extractors, destinations).
Deployment:
Host on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Heroku) for 24/7 availability.
Add authentication later for security.
Conclusion
Your templated service is a logical extension of Feather’s capabilities. By standardizing outputs (e.g., as strings with optional input extractors), you can chain agents into pipelines that run 24/7 on a server, triggered by API calls, with outputs broadcast to multiple channels. This setup meets your needs for flexibility, usability, and automation, making it a robust solution for creating and managing AI agent pipelines.
